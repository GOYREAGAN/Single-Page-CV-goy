For the first time i applied what i have been learning from tutorials thanks to the developers of Roadmap.sh, you should check it out if you haven't (the website: Roadmap.sh).
By the way you should ignore the appearance of my CV, i badly wanted to style it with CSS but too bad i can't because am following a roadmap and i had to fully use HTML alone 🤦‍♂️.
I don't even know what am writing, I think the README.md is suppose to explain the project or the code i wrote??? 🤷‍♂️(DM me if you know its purpose)
